Problem Definition: Write an 8051 Program to -
Transfer the block from internal memory location 30h to internal memory location 40h.

Aim: To understand concept of internal memory organization, various addressing modes and external memory accessing.

Hardware and Software requirements: IBM PC, Keil software

Algorithm:

1. Start

2. Load count value in register.

3. Point Ro to internal memory location 30h

4. Point R1 to internal memory location 40h

5. Copy contents of memory pointed by R0 to Accumulator

6. Copy contents of Accumulator to memory pointed by R1

8. Increment R0

9. Increment R1

10. Decrement counter

11. If counter is not zero go to step 3

12. Stop.


Conclusion:
We have studied to access internal memory using indirect addressing mode.
